#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is the process of designing, creating, testing and maintaining software.
- They play an important role by ensuring software products are secure from vulnerabilities and attacks, cost-efficient, scalable, of high quality, reliable and meet user needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. 1950s-1960s: Development of First-Generation Programming Languages and Operating Systems
    * It marks the genesis of software engineering and the development of Fortran and COBOL programming languages. Introduction of GM-NAA and Atlas operating systems.
2. 1970s-1980s: Introduction of Structured Programming and Methodologies.
    * Top-down design and stepwise refinement structured programming techniques emerged during this period. Computer-Aided Software Engineering, CASE tools, was developed during this period and automated some aspects of software development. Methodologies like Yourdon Structured Analysis and Design Techniques (SADT) and Jackson Structured Programming (JSP) became popular
3. 1990s-2000s: Agile Development and Model-Driven Engineering
    * Agile development methodologies were developed and gained popularity during this stage. Object-oriented programming(OOP) saw growth and widespread adoption of Unified Modelling Language (UML)

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirments - This phase involves understanding user needs, defining what the software should do, and gathering and documenting resources to use for software development.
2. Design - It involves creating a blueprint of how the software will look like and how it will work. A prototype model may be developed to visualize the product.
3. Implementation - This is where the design is turned into code.
4. Testing - After development, it is tested to make sure it meets its requirements.
5. Deployment - This involves releasing the final product to the user.
6. Maintenance - Involves ongoing support, fixing bugs and refining the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
* **Structure**: Waterfall follows a linear process where each phase depends on the completion of the previous one, while Agile is flexible and iterative.
* **Flexibility**: Waterfall has no to little room for changes, while Agile give room for changes based on ongoing feedback.
* **Timeline**: Waterfall takes longer since each phase must be completed fully before beginning the next phase, while Agile timeline is shorter for each sprint, but the whole project can evolve over time as you learn and adapt.
* **Planning**: Waterfall requires a lot of up-front planning since you need to know exactly what your end product is before you start because making changes later is difficult, while in Agile planning is done in small chunks, start with what you know and build something and improve it step by step based on feedback.

**Example**
     Waterfall methodology is suitable for projects with fixed requirement and well defined outcome.
     Agile methodology is appropriate for projects where requirements are likely to change, for example building a mobile app.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- **Software Developer**
    * Their role is to build software. They are responsible for writing code to implement software and fixing bugs and issues in the software
- **Quality Assurance Engineer**
    * Their role is to make sure the software is working correctly. They are responsible for testing software to catch bugs, creating test cases and verifying that the software meets specified requirements.
- **Project Manager**
    * Their role is to oversee the planning, execution, and completion of software projects. They are responsible for planning and setting project timelines and deadlines, communicating with stakeholders to keep them informed, Coordinating tasks and responsibilities among team members and monitoring the project's progress and making adjustment as needed.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**
    * Provides an environment for software developers to write, compile, debug, and test their code. Examples of IDE are PyCharm, Visual Studio and NetBeans.
- **Version Control Systems (VCS)**
    * They provide a platform to keep track of changes to source code and collaboration between teams. Examples are GIT and Bitbucket.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Technology is changing rapidly it becomes a challenge to keep up with the changes. To overcome this challenge join communities and keep on learning and practising through building side projects.
2. Sometimes requirements are incomplete, not clear or they are subject to change making it difficult to develop a solution that meets the stakeholders' needs. To overcome this adopt agile methodology, engage stakeholders to clarify the requirements and build a prototype to visualize the final product.
3. Meeting tight deadlines poses a challenge and can lead in rushed development and compromising on quality. To overcome this prioritize tasks, set realistic timelines and automate repetitive tasks.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- **Unit testing**
    * Involve testing a single module or component isolated from the rest of the code. This verifies if each module or component is working as per expectation. This helps with early bug detection.
- **Integration testing**
    * This tests if different parts of the software are working perfectly together. This helps to verify each part of the software is playing it role as per specification.
- **System testing**
    * This tests the whole software product and checks if it meets the specifications provided. It matters because it verifies if the software meets the requirements and works well from start to finish and with different platforms.
- **Acceptance testing**
    * This involve testing the software against user requirements to make sure it meets user needs. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
* **Prompting engineering** is the process of providing AI with context that guides AI to generate the best response.
* Prompting engineering leads to getting better results for your query. Also by utilizing it, you can break a complex question into smaller parts enabling you to be able to utilise the full power of AI to handle it.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- **Vague Prompt**
    * list software development topics

- **Improved prompt**
    * list some related topics to back-end software developer that should be explored to gain a broader understanding. describe how they are connected
